Inca 2.5: August 21, 2009

  * Added "approval" capability to reporter manager.  This is an automated
    version of "manual" mode.  The agent will queues changes so that a
    resource administrator can view and approve them (using approveChanges
    command) before they get trasmitted to reporter manager.  A reporter
    manager can still be installed and started manually.  

  * Modified reporter managers to persist their schedules to disk (rather than
    resending on restart).  Changes will only be committed to the depot once
    they are comitted to the reporter manager.

  * Added 'globus4' as an access method to create remote reporter managers
    using a Globus WS server (and GridFTP server).

  * Added ability to do "run now" from consumer.  Ability is optional and
    can be turned off/on via a new admin page.  Requires authentication by
    default.

  * Added ability to fetch latest data in XML or HTML format using REST urls

  * Added entity-specific permissions.  Specific Reporter Managers now can
    insert reports only for the resource they monitor, not for any resource.

  * Renamed INFO menu item in Inca web pages to ADMIN.  Added a new page to
    the ADMIN menu to display detailed (expanded) running reporter details
    (protected page because displays email addresses).

  * Added View/Change configuration page to Inca web page under ADMIN menu.
    Allows Inca administrators to enable/disable consumer run nows, view/change
    Google map configuration, and view/change summary view periods rather than
    editing XML directly.

  * Performance improvement to depot queries to use switch query methods
    based on number of reports a series has.  

  * Modified summaryHistory.jsp to display multiple or total lines per graph.
    Also added form to filter by specific resources and/or suites

  * Updated Google Map view to Google Maps API v3 (keys no longer required).
    Also Added map type control and ability to specify default map type in
    Google Map view (e.g., satellite)

  * Added web service support for queryDb query

  * Made IncaWS.wsdl available from Inca website

  * The hostname is now considered part of the unique identifier of a report.
    Previously, reports that came from different hosts w/in the same resource
    were merged if their output was identical.

  * The --trusted command-line switch now accepts a fully-qualified file path
    as an alternate to a resource name.

  * incaws now re-establishes connection if agent or depot has been restarted

  * removed <id> tags from unitalias/version tests in consumer XML files used by swStack.xsl

  * removed resourceId argument from instance.xsl stylesheet and updated
    jsp tags and files

Inca 2.4: July 3, 2008

  * Rewrote Inca consumer and ported it to Jetty 6.  A new REPORTS menu was
    added with pages for displaying historical summary data (see Section 6.2
    in the user guide for more details).  A new QUERY menu was added to graph
    series history, add custom queries, and query the depot (see Section 6.3
    in the userguide for more details).  An HTTPS server is now started by
    default to protect access the later 2 items in the QUERY menu.  

  * Added python Reporter API classes and reporters cluster.admin.dir.usage,
    cluster.admin.posixps.unit, cluster.devel.gmake.version, and
    cluster.uptime.performance.

  * Modified incat to prompt for a resource in response to the "Run Now ..."
    button; the series will only be run on the selected resource.

  * Added filtering capability in depot that enables incoming reports to be
    modified before being stored into the db.  The primary motivation for
    this feature is to differentiate errors that occur during a scheduled 
    downtimes from regular errors.  Further details are provided in the user
    guide under "Report Filtering".

  * Changed repository refresh in incat to an asynchronous action so control
    is returned to the user more quickly

  * Added support for -X switch to incpack.

  * Enabled macro use in cron schedule, limits, and acceptable output expr

  * Upgraded j2ssh libraries on the agent to 1.2.9

    and documentation for how to configure it in incat.

  * Added additional reporters: 
      cluster.admin.dir.usage
      data.transfer.gridftp.unit.copy-dns
      data.transfer.gridftp.unit.auth-dns
      summary.successpct.performance

  * Fixed bug that caused report bodies to include cwd at print time, rather
    than at reporter creation time.
  
  * Fix to Reporter.pm's loggedCommand method--wasn't killing spawned processes

  * Fixed bug in Globus access method where HOME was not getting properly
    resolved

  * Reviewed, corrected, and made consistent all reporters' use of the
    loggedCommand method.  About 65 reporters were changed and their versions
    incremented.

Inca 2.3:  February 11, 2008
  
  * Add support for customizing notifiers via a script

    reporter manager when executing reporters with proxies.

  * Took out usage from error message when reports are timed out so that
    reports can be grouped. 

  * Improved working and appearance of incat's macro dialog

  * Fixed bug that prevented find from working in the report list of incat's
    series dialog

  * Changed the way list values w/in repository catalog Packages.gz are
    notated.  This has the effect of allowing ; to appear in the default
    values of reporter arguments.  The Inca software is backward-compatible,
    so no changes to existing catalogs are required.  Incpack script
    updated.

  * Performance improvements to Depot query responses

  * Trim debugging output from Depot log
  
  * Changed email notifications to send only if result is different even when
    other series params change

  * Fixed bug where '-' was not allowed in reporter argument names.

  * Fixed bug where ?-x was not being recognized as valid field in the cron
    string, i.e., equivalent to ?-x/1

  * Fallback to use ip address if unable to get a FQDN for the agent (for
    reporter managers to use to contact the agent).

  * Fixed incat find feature in "Add series" window.

  * Fixed incat bug where hitting cancel after the File->open menu cleared
    the current configuration

  * Fixed bug that was intepreting ~ in the reporter manager install path
    as part of the directory name rather than the home directory

  * Added reporter descriptions to list_reporters.cgi output

  * Depot and xsl stylesheet changes to better display stale reports (stale
    reports are marked with an asterisk by default.xsl and swStack.xsl)

  * Added a restart command to the inca script

  * Added a prompt for password verification in createauth command

  * Added a new summary status view using the Google Maps API available
    from the consumer tab "map of sampleSuite results" under "CURRENT DATA".

  * Revised consumer documentation in user guide

  * Changed reporter manager credential creation process so that instead of
    being generated by the agent and transmitted to the reporter manager,
    a key and certificate request are created by the reporter manager.  The
    certificate request is then fetched by the agent which generates a 
    certificate and transmits it to the reporter manager.  The directions
    for the manual reporter manager have also been modified accordingly.

  * XML and XSL files for the consumer have been moved from etc to 
    webapps/xml and webapps/xsl respectively.  The war files have moved
    from webapps to webapps/war.

    are now only emailed when needed (i.e., not after a restart nor
    run now).  The changes are sent as 2 attachments, one with just
    the changes and the other containing the suite with the updates
    already included.  There is also a way to customize the text that
    gets sent in the message in etc/manualEmail.txt

  * refactored xsl stylesheets to be make them easier to modify
